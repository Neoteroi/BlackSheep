# BlackSheep
BlackSheep is an asynchronous web framework to build event based web
applications with Python. It is inspired by
[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), [ASP.NET
Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/), and the work by [Yury
Selivanov](https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/).

</p>

```bash
pip install blacksheep
```

---

```python
from datetime import datetime

from blacksheep import Application


app = Application()

@app.route("/")
async def home():
    return f"Hello, World! {datetime.utcnow().isoformat()}"

```

## Getting started

The documentation offers getting started tutorials:
* [Getting started:
  basics](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/getting-started/)
* [Getting started: the MVC project
  template](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/mvc-project-template/)

These project templates can be used to start new applications faster:

* [MVC project
  template](https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheepMVC)
* [Empty project
  template](https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheepEmptyProject)

## Requirements

[Python](https://www.python.org): any version listed in the project's
classifiers. The current list is:

[![versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/blacksheep.svg)](https://github.com/robertoprevato/blacksheep)


BlackSheep belongs to the category of
[ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) web frameworks, so it requires
an ASGI HTTP server to run, such as [uvicorn](http://www.uvicorn.org/), or
[hypercorn](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/). For example, to use it with
uvicorn:

```bash
$ pip install uvicorn
```

To run an application like in the example above, use the methods provided by
the ASGI HTTP Server:

```bash
# if the BlackSheep app is defined in a file `server.py`

$ uvicorn server:app
```

To run for production, refer to the documentation of the chosen ASGI server
(i.e. for [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/#running-with-gunicorn)).

## Automatic bindings and dependency injection
BlackSheep supports automatic binding of values for request handlers, by type
annotation or by conventions. See [more
here](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/requests/).

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from blacksheep import Application, FromJSON, FromQuery


app = Application()


@dataclass
class CreateCatInput:
    name: str


@app.router.post("/api/cats")
async def example(data: FromJSON[CreateCatInput]):
    # in this example, data is bound automatically reading the JSON
    # payload and creating an instance of `CreateCatInput`
    ...


@app.router.get("/:culture_code/:area")
async def home(culture_code, area):
    # in this example, both parameters are obtained from routes with
    # matching names
    return f"Request for: {culture_code} {area}"


@app.router.get("/api/products")
def get_products(
    page: int = 1,
    size: int = 30,
    search: str = "",
):
    # this example illustrates support for implicit query parameters with
    # default values
    # since the source of page, size, and search is not specified and no
    # route parameter matches their name, they are obtained from query string
    ...


@app.router.get("/api/products2")
def get_products2(
    page: FromQuery[int] = FromQuery(1),
    size: FromQuery[int] = FromQuery(30),
    search: FromQuery[str] = FromQuery(""),
):
    # this example illustrates support for explicit query parameters with
    # default values
    # in this case, parameters are explicitly read from query string
    ...

```

It also supports [dependency
injection](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/dependency-injection/), a
feature that provides a consistent and clean way to use dependencies in request
handlers.

## Generation of OpenAPI Documentation
[Generation of OpenAPI Documentation](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/openapi/).

## Strategies to handle authentication and authorization
BlackSheep implements strategies to handle authentication and authorization.
These features are documented here:

* [Authentication](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/authentication/)
* [Authorization](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/authorization/)

```python
app.use_authentication()\
    .add(ExampleAuthenticationHandler())


app.use_authorization()\
    .add(AdminsPolicy())


@auth("admin")
@app.router.get("/")
async def only_for_admins():
    ...


@auth()
@app.router.get("/")
async def only_for_authenticated_users():
    ...
```

Since version `1.2.1`, BlackSheep implements:

* [Built-in support for OpenID Connect authentication](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/authentication/#oidc)
* [Built-in support for JWT Bearer authentication](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/authentication/#jwt-bearer)

Meaning that it is easy to integrate with services such as:
* [Auth0](https://auth0.com)
* [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/)
* [Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview)
* [Okta](https://www.okta.com)

Refer to the documentation for more details and examples.
