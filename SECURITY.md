# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

In general, due to limited maintainer bandwidth, only the latest version of
BlackSheep is supported with patch releases. Exceptions may be made depending
on the severity of the bug and the feasibility of backporting a fix to
older releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

BlackSheep uses GitHub's security advisory functionality for private vulnerability
reports. To make a private report, please use the "Report a vulnerability" button at
[https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheep/security/advisories](https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheep/security/advisories).
