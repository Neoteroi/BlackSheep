"""
This module provides integration for OpenTelemetry using OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol)
exporters for logging and tracing in BlackSheep applications. This code is vendor
agnostic as it can work with all providers supporting the OpenTelemetry Protocol
(e.g. OpenTelemtry Collector, Grafana Alloy).

It defines a helper function to configure OpenTelemetry with OTLPLogExporter and
OTLPSpanExporter, ensuring that all required OTLP-related environment variables are set
before initialization.

Additional dependencies:
    pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp

Usage:
    from blacksheep.server.otel.otlp import use_open_telemetry_otlp

    use_open_telemetry_otlp(app)
